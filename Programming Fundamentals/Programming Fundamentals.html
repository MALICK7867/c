                    <p>
                        Common Operating Machine Purposly Used for Technology, Education and Research is known as a COMPUTER. A computer is a electronic device which takes input from a user and then process this data into information and save or store the information in its storage devices and provide us with result when desired.
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Takes Input</li>
                            <li>Process</li>
                            <li>Store</li>

                    <h3 id="what_is_program">What is Program</h3>
                    <p>
                        A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task. For example, sorting numbers, calculating grades are basic examples of a program. <em>A process of writing code in order to give instructions to a computer is called Programming.</em>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="programming_language">Programming Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A programming language is a notational system for describing instructions for computer in a machine-readable and human-readable form. There are many programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Assembly etc. However, each programming language has its own programming rules, sytax and structures.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="levels_of_programming_language">Levels of Programming Languages</h2>
                    <h3 id="low_level_programming">Low Level Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        The programming languages which are easily understandable to machines but difficult to understand for human. There are two types of low level programming. ie.
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Machine Language</li>
                            <li>Assembly Language</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="machine_language">Machine Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Machine Language consist of binary numbers (1,0). It is difficult for a human being to write codes in machine language. Program writing, reading, debugging and upgrading in machine language is very difficult for human. Therefore the programming in Machine Language is too slow.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="assembly_language">Assembly Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Assembly language uses symbolic codes which easy to remember such as ADD, SUM, MOV etc. Theses symbolic codes are developed against some binary codes. So writing, reading, debugging and upgrading the programs in Assembly language become easy as compare to the Binary Language.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="high_level_programming">High Level Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        To speed up the programming process High level Languages are developed. These languages are human friendly because these are more close to the human language. High-level languages, such as C, C++, Java, C#, Swift and Visual Basic, allow to write instructions that more like English and mathematical notations. However, High Level Languages are NOT directly understandable by the machines. They need to be translated into machine level. These languages are machine independent; i-e portable.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="language_processor">Language Processor</h2>
                    <p>
                        A language processor is a type of software program that translates the High Level Language program (source code) into Machine Language (object code). Language processor is also called language translator. 
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li><b>Source Code: </b>The program written by the user.</li>
                            <li><b>Object Code: </b>The program translated into machine language.</li>

                    <h3 id="what_is_compiler">Compiler</h3>
                    <p>
                        Compiler converts program written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once, before program runs.

                    <h3 id="introduction_to_errors">What is an Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming errors are referred to as mistakes or bugs in the program. There are three types of errors:
                        <ol id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Syntax Error</li>
                            <li>Runtime Error</li>
                            <li>Logical Error</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="syntax_error">Syntax Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occurs at the time of compilation. It usually occurs due to an error in the rules & regulation or structure of the program. It do not allow the program to get compiled and as a result not result in execution of program. It is very easy to find because compiler programs usually highlight the error.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="runtime_error">Runtime Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occur at the time of execution. Occurs due to an illegal operation in the program such as dividing by zero, referencing an invalid file, calling invalid function. It cause the program to stop or crash. It is diffult to identify as compared to Syntax error.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="logical_error">Logical Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occur at the time of execution. It usually occur due to incorrect logic or fault in the algorithm in the program such as incorrect sequence of instuctions. It do not stop the compilation or execution of the program but gives wrong output of the program. It is very hard and complex to identify.

                        An IDE or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to assist computer programmers and software developers in creating, testing, and managing software applications. Some of the key components and features typically found in an IDE include:
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Editor</li>
                            <li>Compilers</li>
                            <li>Debugger</li>
                            <li>Linkers</li>
                            <li>Loaders</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this course we will be using Dev C++ 5.11 as an IDE.

                    <h2 id="datatype">Datatypes</h2>
                    <h3 id="variable">Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        During programming we need to store data like marks, names, etc. To store these values we use variables. These variables are located in the <span class="discriptive" title="RAM">memory</span> of system. This memory is divided into blocks and each block has its own unique numberical address. To store and access these blocks of the memory, we give them a name and these are called variables. These are called variables because the value is different or may change and store different values at different time. These variables are declared using these rules:
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Type of variable</li>
                            <li>A name of variable</li>
                            <li>Size of variable</li>
                            <li>Value stored in variable</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="variable_types">Variable Type</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable must have a datatype associated with it. It is used to identify which type of data is stored in a variable. For example:
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Integer (used for storing whole numbers)</li>
                            <li>Float (used for storing numbers, decimal points)</li>
                            <li>Character (used to store alphabets)</li>
                            <li>Boolean (true/false)</li>
                            <li>String (used to store text)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="variable_size">Variable Size</h3>
                    <p>
                        Different variables have different size. It is a datatype which tells us about the size of the variable. It depends on the IDE to assign size to a specific datatype. Here, we will discuss the size of different variables used in Dev C++. ie.
                        <ul id="tutorial_list">
                            <li>Integer (int) = 4 Bytes</li>
                            <li>Float (float) = 4 Bytes</li>
                            <li>Double (double) = 8 Bytes</li>
