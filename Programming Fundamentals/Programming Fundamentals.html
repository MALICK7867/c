                    <p>
                        Common Operating Machine Purposly Used for Technology, Education and Research is known as a
                        COMPUTER. A computer is a electronic device which takes input from a user and then process this
                        data into information and save or store the information in its storage devices and provide us
                        with result when desired.

                    <p>
                        A problem is a situation or matter that requires proper attention to be solved. It is a process
                        of identifying a problem and finding its best solution. It is a skill that can be developed by
                        following a well-organized approach. <br> Different strategies, techniques and tools are used to
                        solve a problem. Computer is a tool which is used to solve complex problems by developing
                        computer programs. A person write instructions and computer executes them to solve a problem. A
                        person can be good programmer if ha has skills of solving problems. <br>Different
                        program-solving techniques are as following:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">

                    <h3 id="what_is_program">What is Program</h3>
                    <p>
                        A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task. For example,
                        sorting numbers, calculating grades are basic examples of a program. <em>A process of writing
                            code in order to give instructions to a computer is called Programming.</em>

                        <li>Computer program can solve many problems by giving instructions to the computer.</li>
                        <li>It can be used to perform a task repeatedly and quickly.</li>
                        <li>It can process large amount of data easily.</li>
                        <li>It can display the result in different styles.</li>
                        <li>The processing of program is more efficient andless time consuming.</li>
                        <li>Different types of programs are used in different fields to perform certain tasks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="programming_language">Programming Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A programming language is a notational system for describing instructions for computer in a
                        machine-readable and human-readable form. There are many programming languages such as C, C++,
                        Java, Python, Assembly etc. However, each programming language has its own programming rules,
                        sytax and structures.

                        <h3 id="low_level_programming">Low Level Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        The programming languages which are easily understandable to machines but difficult to
                        understand for human. There are two types of low level programming. ie.
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Machine Language</li>
                        <li>Assembly Language</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="machine_language">Machine Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Machine Language consist of binary numbers (1,0). It is difficult for a human being to write
                        codes in machine language. Program writing, reading, debugging and upgrading in machine language
                        is very difficult for human. Therefore the programming in Machine Language is too slow.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="assembly_language">Assembly Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Assembly language uses symbolic codes which easy to remember such as ADD, SUM, MOV etc. Theses
                        symbolic codes are developed against some binary codes. So writing, reading, debugging and
                        upgrading the programs in Assembly language become easy as compare to the Binary Language.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="high_level_programming">High Level Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        To speed up the programming process High level Languages are developed. These languages are
                        human friendly because these are more close to the human language. High-level languages, such as
                        C, C++, Java, C#, Swift and Visual Basic, allow to write instructions that more like English and
                        mathematical notations. However, High Level Languages are NOT directly understandable by the
                        machines. They need to be translated into machine level. These languages are machine
                        independent; i-e portable.

                    <p>
                        Many new programming languages appeared during the 1960s. The computers at that time were still
                        in early stage of development. The language ALGOL60 was developed as an alternative to FORTAN.
                        <br>Ken Thompson createdB language in 1970. C language was derived from B language. The B
                        language provided the basis for the development of C. The C language was originally designed to
                        write programs under UNIX operating system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span id="bold">Bjarne Stroustrup</span> from <span id="bold">Bell Labs</span> started the
                        development of C++ language in 1980. The first commercial release of C++ appeared in October
                        1985. It was originally named "C with classes". It was an improved version of C which allows the
                        use of programming technique known as object oriented programming (OOP).

                        Some important features of C++ are mentioned:
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="convinient_language">Convinient Language</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is very convinient language. It provides many facilities in easier way that are diffiluct to
                        use in low level languages. The programmers can write more complex codes more easily as compared
                        to low-level languages.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="well_structured_language">Well Structured Language</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is well structured language. Its syntax is very easy to understand. The programs written in
                        C++ language are very easy to maintain and modify.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="case_sensitive">Case Sensitivity</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is case sensitive language. It means that it can differentiate uppercase and lowercase
                        words. All keywords are written in lowercase. This feature makes it easier to maintain the code.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="machine_independency">Machine Independence</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ language provides machine independence. It means that the programs written in C++ language
                        can be executed on different types of computers.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="object_orientedf">Object Oriented</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is an object-oriented language. In object-oriented technique, the programs are written on
                        the basis of objects. An object is a collection of data and function.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="modular_programming">Modular Programming</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ language provides a facility of modular programming which means that the program can be
                        divided into modules which increases the maintainablity of code. These modules can be developed
                        and compiled independently and then linked together.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="standard_libraries">Standard Libraries</h4>
                    <p>
                        The standard C++ library is a set of functions, constants, classes and objects to extend C++
                        language.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="hardware_control">Hardware Control</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ provides cloase control on hardware. The programmer can write efficient programs to control
                        hardware components of computer system.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="brevity">Brevity</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is a small language. It has a small number of keywords and programming controls but still
                        very powerful for developing different types of programs. The code written in C++ is very small
                        as compared to other languages.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ compilers generate very fast code. The resulting code from a C++ compilation is very
                        efficient. The program executes very efficiently and program takes less time to execute.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="popular_language">Popular Language</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is a very widely used programming language. There are many tools available for C++
                        programming and a broad base of programmers contributing to C++ community.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="c_compatibility">C Compatibility</h4>
                    <p>
                        C++ is backward compatible with C language. Any code written in C language can easily be
                        included in a C++ program without hardly making any changes.

                            Preprocessive directives are instructions given to the preprocessor. The preprocessor directives
                            are processed by a program known as preprocessor. It is part of C++ compiler. It is part of C++
                            compiler. It modifies C++ source program before compilation. The semicolon is not used at the
                            end of preprocessor directives. The preprocessor directives start with hash symbol (#). These
                            directives are written at the start of program.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Include preprocessor directive is used to include header files in the program. The syntax of
                            using this directive is as follows:
                        <div class="codes"><code>

                        <p>
                            The above statement tells the compiler to include the file iostream in the source program before
                            compiling it.

                        <p>
                            Header files are collection of standard library functions and objects to perform different
                            tasks. C++ provides many header files for different purposes. Each header file contains
                            different type of predefined functions and objects. Many header files can be included in one
                            program. The header file must be included in the program before calling any of its functions.
                            The name of header file is written in angle brackets. These files are provided by C++ compiler
                            system. <br><span id="bold">Syntax: </span> <br>The syntax of header file is as following:

                            The main() function is the starting point of a C++ program. The control enters main() function
                            and starts executing its statements when the program is run. A program that do not have main()
                            function can be compiled but can not be executed. The syntax of main function is:

                    <h4>1. Standard Identifier:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A type of identifier that has special meaning in C++ is known as standard identifier. C++ cannot
                        use a standard identifier for its original purpose if it is redefined.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>
                        cout and cin are examples of standard identifiers. These are the same names of input/output
                        objects defined in standard input/output library &ltiostream&gt
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. User-defined Identifiers:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The type of identifier that is defined by the programmer to access memory location is known as
                        user-defined identifier. The user-defined identifier are used to store data and program result.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some examples of user-defined identifiers are "marks", "age", etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="keywords">Keywords</h3>
                    <p>
                        Keyword is a word in C++ that has a predefined meaning and purpose. The meaning and purpose of a
                        keyword is defined by the developer of the language. It cannot be changed or redefined by the
                        user. Keyword can be used for the same purpose for which it is defined. There are 63 different
                        types of keywords in C++. The list of these keywords is:

                    <p>
                        During programming we need to store data like marks, names, etc. To store these values we use
                        variables. These variables are located in the <span class="discriptive"
                            title="RAM">memory</span> of system. This memory is divided into blocks and each block has
                        its own unique numberical address. To store and access these blocks of the memory, we give them
                        a name and these are called variables. These are called variables because the value is different
                        or may change and store different values at different time. These variables are declared using
                        these rules:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Type of variable</li>
                        <li>A name of variable</li>
                        <li>Size of variable</li>
                        <li>Value stored in variable</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="variable_types">Variable Type</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable must have a datatype associated with it. It is used to identify which type of data is
                        stored in a variable. For example:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Integer (used for storing whole numbers)</li>
                        <li>Float (used for storing numbers, decimal points)</li>
                        <li>Character (used to store alphabets)</li>
                        <li>Boolean (true/false)</li>
                        <li>String (used to store text)</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="variable_size">Variable Size</h3>
                    <p>
                        Different variables have different size. It is a datatype which tells us about the size of the
                        variable. It depends on the IDE to assign size to a specific datatype. Here, we will discuss the
                        size of different variables used in Dev C++. ie.
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Integer (int) = 4 Bytes</li>
                        <li>Float (float) = 4 Bytes</li>
                        <li>Double (double) = 8 Bytes</li>
                        <li>Character (char) = 1 Byte</li>
                        <li>String (string) = 8 Bytes</li>
                        <li>Boolean (bool) = 1 Byte</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="variable_name">Variable Name</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use naming conventions to declare variable names. Variable should be given name which matches
                        the nature of the data. Variable names should be legal. For example:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Names can contain series oof characters consisting of letters, digits and underscores(_)
                        </li>
                        <li>It can not be started by a number or digit or any special character.</li>
                        <li>Spaces are not allowed</li>
                        <li>Keywords or reserved words are not allowed</li>
                        <li>Uppercase and lowercase letters are two different characters. So, a1 and A1 are different.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In terms of scope, variables are categorized into two broad types:

                    <h4>Local Variables</h4>
                    <p>
                        Local variables are those whcih are declared in the body of a function. These variables are
                        accessible within the body of the function.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Global Variables</h4>
                    <p>
                        These variables are declared outside the body of all functions. These variables are accessible
                        anywhere in the program.

                    <p>
                        Programming errors are referred to as mistakes or bugs in the program. There are three types of
                        errors:
                    <ol id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Syntax Error</li>
                        <li>Runtime Error</li>
                        <li>Logical Error</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="syntax_error">Syntax Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occurs at the time of compilation. It usually occurs due to an error in the
                        rules & regulation or structure of the program. It do not allow the program to get compiled and
                        as a result not result in execution of program. It is very easy to find because compiler
                        programs usually highlight the error.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="runtime_error">Runtime Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occur at the time of execution. Occurs due to an illegal operation in the
                        program such as dividing by zero, referencing an invalid file, calling invalid function. It
                        cause the program to stop or crash. It is diffult to identify as compared to Syntax error.

                    <h3 id="logical_error">Logical Error</h3>
                    <p>
                        A type of error that occur at the time of execution. It usually occur due to incorrect logic or
                        fault in the algorithm in the program such as incorrect sequence of instuctions. It do not stop
                        the compilation or execution of the program but gives wrong output of the program. It is very
                        hard and complex to identify.

                    <p>
                        An IDE or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a
                        comprehensive set of tools and features to assist computer programmers and software developers
                        in creating, testing, and managing software applications. Some of the key components and
                        features typically found in an IDE include:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Editor</li>
                        <li>Compilers</li>
                        <li>Debugger</li>
                        <li>Linkers</li>
                        <li>Loaders</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this course we will be using Dev C++ 5.11 as an IDE. You can download this free software by

                    <p>
                        Type conversion allows a compiler to convert one datatype at the time of compilation of a
                        program. This is called implicit type conversion. <br>There is a data loss when using this type
                        of conversion. Data loss happens when data of larger type is converted into smaller type.
                    <div class="figure"><img src="Images/data loss.png" alt="Data Loss"></div>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are some rules which must be kept in mind while using type conversion. These are: <br>
                        When operating with values of different data types, the lower ranked value will be promoted to
                        higher data type. <br>When using assignment operator (=), the type of expression on right side
                        will be converted into type of left side variable.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="truncate">Truncate</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a higher or upper datatype is converted into lower or smaller datatype, it gets demoted and
                        may lose data. This process is called Truncate and datatype is truncated. For example: when an
                        floating point value is converted into integer type value, it gets truncated.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="promote">Promote</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a smaller or lower datatype is converted into higher or upper datatype, it gets Promoted.
                        This makes values more accurate. For example: when an integer is converted to floating point
                        value, is gets promoted.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="explicit_type_conversion">Explicit Type Conversion</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the user manually changes data from one type to another, this is known as type casting.
                        This type of conversion is also called explicit type conversion. Syntax:
                    <div class="codes"><code>
                                Static_cast&ltDataType&gt(Expression); <br>
                                OR <br>
                                (DataType) Expression;
                            </code></div>
