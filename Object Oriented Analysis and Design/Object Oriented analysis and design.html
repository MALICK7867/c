                        Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the <span class="discriptive"
                            title="Software Development Life Cycle">SDLC</span>. It involves
                        gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders to define the features
                        and functionalities of a software system or application. The primary goal of requirement analysis is to
                        ensure that the final software product meets the intended objectives and satisfies user needs.

                        The process of studying and analyzing the customer and the user/stakeholder needs to arrive at a
                        definition of software requirements.

                    </ul>
                    Model can be translated to data, architectural, and component-level designs and expect to do a little bit of
                    design during analysis and a little bit of analysis during design.

                        Requirement validation is a crucial step in the software development process. It is the process of
                        reviewing and evaluating the gathered requirements to ensure that they are <span class="discriptive"

                            the needs</span> of the stakeholders. The primary goal of requirement validation is to identify and
                        rectify any issues or discrepancies in the requirements before they are used as the basis for designing
                        and building the software system. <br>Requirements error costs are high so validation is very important.
                        Fixing a requirements error after delivery may cost up to 100 times the cost of fixing an implementation
                        error.

                    <h3 id="Software_Requirement_Specification">Software Requirement Specification (SRS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        SRS is a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed. It is basically an
                        organization's understanding (in writing) of a customer or potential client's system requirements and
                        dependencies at a particular point in time prior to any actual design or development work. It states in
                        percise and explicit language those functions and capabilities a software system must provide, as well
                        as states any required constraints by which the system must be abide. SRS is a blueprint for completing
                        a project with as little cost growth as possible.

                        <li><b>Consistent: </b> SRS capability functions n performance level are compatible, and the features

                        <li><b>Modifiable: </b>The logical, hirarchical structure of SRS should facilitate any necessary

                    <p>
                        Use case modeling is a technique in software engineering and systems engineering that helps define,
                        clarify, and document the interactions between various actors (such as users or other systems) and a
                        system under development. It is a fundamental part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is a
                        standardized modeling language used in software development. Use case modeling focuses on capturing the
                        functional requirements of a system from a user's perspective.

                    <h3 id="Goals_and_Objective">Difference Between Goals and Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        Goals are typically broader, more overarching, and focused on the long term. They represent the ultimate
                        outcome you aim to achieve. Goals are often less specific and more general in nature. They provide a
                        direction but may not detail how to achieve the desired outcome. <br>Objectives are more specific,
                        concrete, and focused on the short to medium term. They outline precisely what needs to be achieved to
                        reach a goal. Objectives are actionable and often require specific tasks or actions to be taken to
                        achieve them.
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li>Goal - Long term</li>
                        <li>Objective - Short term</li>
                    </ul>
                    To achieve goal you have to complete objectives. Every user has his own objectives called requirements or
                    needs of a user. Here we use user oriented case to get requirements from user which is called <span

                    <p>
                        The process of how a user communicate with the system to complete its goal or objective is known as
                        interaction. For example: A user is given a goal to format a document. He can use this process to format
                        a word document:

                    <p>
                        A specific method to achieve a goal is called scenerio. It is called use-case modeling and are used for
                        functional requirements of a system.There are two types of scenerio:

                        Some advantages of use case modeling are discussed as:
                    <ul id="tutorial_list">
                        <li><b>Requirements Clarification:</b> It helps stakeholders and developers clearly understand how the
                            system will be used and what functionality it should provide.</li>
                        <li><b>Communication:</b> Use case diagrams provide an effective way to communicate system behavior and
                            requirements to all project stakeholders.</li>
                        <li><b>Testing and Validation:</b> Use cases can serve as the basis for test cases, ensuring that the
                            system meets its intended functionality.</li>
                        <li><b>Project Planning:</b> Use case diagrams can aid in project planning and task allocation by
                            breaking down system functionality into manageable components.</li>
                        <li><b>Use Case Diagram:</b> A use case represents a specific interaction between an actor (user or
                            system) and the system being developed. It describes a particular functionality or feature of the
                            system from the perspective of how it will be used.</li>
                        <li><b>Actor:</b> An actor is an external entity that interacts with the system. Actors can be users,
                            other systems, or even hardware components. Each actor typically has specific roles or
                            responsibilities within the system.</li>
                        <li><b>System Boundary:</b> The system boundary defines the scope of the system being modeled. It
                            separates the system from its external actors. Use cases take place within this boundary.</li>
                        <li><b>Relationships:</b> Use cases can have relationships with one another. Common relationships
                            include "extends" (for optional behavior) and "includes" (for common behavior shared between use
                            cases). These relationships help to modularize and organize the use case model.</li>
                        <li><b>Generalization:</b> Use cases can be organized hierarchically using generalization relationships.
                            This is similar to inheritance in object-oriented programming, where one use case (the child)
                            inherits behavior from another (the parent).</li>
                        <li><b>Diagram:</b> Use case diagrams are graphical representations of use cases, actors, and their
                            relationships. These diagrams provide a visual overview of how the system interacts with its users
                            or external systems.</li>
                    </ul>

                        A simple but very effective model used during the analysis phase for analysing functional requirements. It is used in use case modeling as a function of a system. <br>It can also be used to gather or analyse non-functional requirements like security.
